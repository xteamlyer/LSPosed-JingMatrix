 * Which root implementation is managing this device, and how to flash through it.
 *
 * The detection mirrors NeoZygisk's `root_impl` module, deliberately: that is the code deciding
 * whether Vector loads at all on this device, and a manager that disagreed with it about which root
 * is in charge would be reporting on a different device than the one it is running on. Where a
 * version floor can be read at all it is NeoZygisk's own, so "too old to flash through" means the
 * same thing in both places.
 *
 * Detection is by binary rather than by NeoZygisk's ioctl/prctl route, which needs a JNI hop for a
 * question asked once — and the binary has to exist anyway to do the flashing. The cost of that
 * choice is visible in [detectKernelSu], which cannot read a version at all.
 *
 * A binary that exists but *fails* is not an implementation: this device carries a leftover
 * `/data/adb/magisk/magisk` from a previous root manager, and it exits 1 with "Cannot connect to
 * daemon". Requiring a clean exit is what stops that from being reported as a second root
 * implementation and turning a working KernelSU device into ROOT_MULTIPLE.
