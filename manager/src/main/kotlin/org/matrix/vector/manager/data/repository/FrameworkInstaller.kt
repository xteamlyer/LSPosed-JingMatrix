 * implementation's installer is a program that takes a *path*, so there has to be a file for it to
 * open. It goes in the manager's own cache directory, which the daemon can read as root, and it is
 * deleted once the installer has exited.
 *
 * **The download is separate from the flash, and reported separately**, because they fail for
 * unrelated reasons and the reader needs to know which happened. A download that dies on a flaky
 * connection has changed nothing on the device; an installer that dies halfway has.
