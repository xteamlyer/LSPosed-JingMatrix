/**
 * Whether a newer build of the framework exists, and which one this reader may be offered.
 *
 * **The channel is derived, not configured.** A preference would be a second source of truth about
 * something the device can simply be asked: someone who flashed a canary once and never changed a
 * setting would keep being offered canaries, and someone on a release build who toggled the setting
 * out of curiosity would be offered nightlies. Neither is what they are running.
 *
 * A build is a canary if either is true:
 *
 * - a `canary-<versionCode>` release exists for exactly this version code, which is the direct
 *   evidence; or
 * - this version code is *higher than the newest stable release*, which catches the canary that has
 *   aged out of the rolling five prereleases and would otherwise look like a release build. It also
 *   correctly classifies a locally built development copy, which is ahead of everything published.
 *
 * A reader on a release build is only ever offered releases. That is the whole point of the
 * distinction: a nightly is not something to be nudged towards.
