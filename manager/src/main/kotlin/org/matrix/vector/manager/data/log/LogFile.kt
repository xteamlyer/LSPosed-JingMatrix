/**
 * A random-access window onto one of the daemon's log files.
 *
 * A single log file is capped today: `logcat.cpp` rotates at 4 MB per part. That cap belongs to
 * the daemon build that happens to be running, though, and the manager cannot inspect the
 * provenance of the descriptor it was handed before it reads from it. **A reader whose peak memory
 * scales with file size is wrong regardless of today's number** — reading a part into `String`s
 * would be megabytes of churn per refresh, inside a process whose heap belongs to
 * `com.android.shell`.
 *
 * So nothing here scales with the file:
 * - [index] never allocates a `String`. It scans bytes for `'\n'` and records line offsets into a
 *   `LongArray` — 8 bytes per line, ~240 KB for a full part, and capped at [MAX_INDEXED_LINES].
 * - [readRows] materialises at most a window's worth of lines, reading them in one seek per
 *   256 KB block. Peak heap is a function of the window size alone.
 * - [scan] streams the whole file to build a filter, but only ever holds one block plus the
 *   matching *offsets*.
 *
 * The descriptor is real and seekable: `ManagerService.getVerboseLog()` opens
 * `/proc/self/fd/N`, which resolves the procfs symlink back to the log inode, so positional reads
 * work and this class exploits them rather than streaming forward.
 *
 * Ownership is exactly one object. [ParcelFileDescriptor.AutoCloseInputStream] adopts the
 * descriptor and closes it once, in [close]. Wrapping the raw `pfd.fileDescriptor` in a
 * `FileInputStream` *and* closing the `ParcelFileDescriptor` separately closes the same fd number
 * twice, and between the two closes the runtime is free to hand that number to an OkHttp socket or
 * a Coil bitmap, which the second close then silently detaches.
