/**
 * The shape of a line in the daemon's log, and the scanner that recovers it.
 *
 * The authority for this format is not a sample of the output — it is the writer,
 * `daemon/src/main/jni/logcat.cpp`, which emits every entry as a single `writev` of
 *
 * ```
 * "[ " %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S ".%03ld %8d:%6d:%6d %c/%-15.*s ] " <message> "\n"
 * ```
 *
 * Three properties of that format decide how this parser is written:
 *
 * 1. **The widths are `printf` minimums, not columns.** A uid of `1010324` is seven digits and a
 *    future pid can exceed six, so the prefix has to be *scanned*. Slicing at constant offsets
 *    works right up until the day it silently does not.
 * 2. **A message containing newlines is still one `writev`.** Its continuation lines therefore
 *    carry no prefix at all — a Java stack trace arrives as one entry followed by N raw lines each
 *    beginning with a tab. Those frames belong to the entry above them, not to nothing.
 * 3. **Not every line is an entry.** `----part N start----` / `-----part N end----` mark the
 *    daemon rotating to a fresh file, and the watchdog writes its own banners. Those are real
 *    information about the log rather than noise, so they survive as [LogRow.Marker] instead of
 *    being dropped.
 *
 * Anything the scanner cannot make sense of degrades to a marker carrying the raw text. A log
 * viewer that hides a line it failed to understand is worse than useless during a diagnosis.
