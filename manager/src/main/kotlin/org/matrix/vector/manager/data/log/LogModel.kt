/**
 * The shape of a line in the daemon's log, and the scanner that recovers it.
 *
 * The authority for this format is not a sample of the output — it is the writer,
 * `daemon/src/main/jni/logcat.cpp`, which emits every entry as a single `writev` of
 *
 * ```
 * "[ " %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S ".%03ld %8d:%6d:%6d %c/%-15.*s ] " <message> "\n"
 * ```
 *
 * Three properties of that format decide how this parser is written:
 *
 * 1. **The widths are `printf` minimums, not columns.** A uid of `1010324` is seven digits and a
 *    future pid can exceed six, so the prefix has to be *scanned*. Slicing at constant offsets
 *    works right up until the day it silently does not.
 * 2. **A message containing newlines is still one `writev`.** Its continuation lines therefore
 *    carry no prefix at all, and *nothing* marks them as continuations — a stack trace's frames
 *    happen to be indented, but a `Caused by:` and `zygisk-core64`'s mount-argument report are
 *    flush left. They belong to the entry above them, not to nothing. See [isContinuationLine].
 *    The exception is a message past the logger's payload, which the *writer* splits into several
 *    entries before liblog ever sees it; [isSplitChunk] puts those back together.
 * 3. **Not every line is an entry.** `----part N start----` / `-----part N end----` mark the
 *    daemon rotating to a fresh file, and the watchdog writes its own banners. Those are real
 *    information about the log rather than noise, so they survive as [LogRow.Marker] instead of
 *    being dropped. They are also the *only* unprefixed lines that are not continuations, which
 *    is what makes rule 2 decidable.
 *
 * Anything the scanner cannot make sense of degrades to a marker carrying the raw text. A log
 * viewer that hides a line it failed to understand is worse than useless during a diagnosis.

/**
 * Whether a line belongs to the entry above it rather than standing on its own.
 *
 * The answer follows from the writer, not from the look of the line. `logcat.cpp` emits an entry as
 * a single `writev` whose first `iovec` is the prefix, so **every** line of a multi-line message
 * after the first arrives without one. An unprefixed line under an entry is therefore a
 * continuation by construction, whatever it looks like.
 *
 * Testing the look instead is what this used to do, and it was wrong in both directions of the same
 * failure. Indented lines passed; anything else was cut loose into [LogRow.Marker], one row per
 * line. `Throwable.printStackTrace` writes its header and every `Caused by:` flush left, so a cause
 * chain shredded. `zygisk-core64` prints a mount-argument block flush left, so a twenty-line report
 * of what it had parsed shredded too — a divider drawn between every line of it, and the whole
 * thing visually detached from the entry that produced it.
 *
 * So the rule is inverted: a line is a continuation unless it is one of the four things the daemon
 * writes raw, which [isRawBanner] names.
 *
 * **Two things the caller must have established first**, neither of which this can see:
 * 1. That [text] is not itself an entry. This answers only "does this *unprefixed* line belong to
 *    the entry above", and a prefixed line is not unprefixed — asked without that check it says yes
 *    to every line in the file, and the log collapses into its first entry with a hundred
 *    continuations hanging off it. [parseLogLine] is the check.
 * 2. That there is an entry above at all. Before the first one of a file, and after a banner, there
 *    is nothing to continue.
 *
 * Both guards are the caller's because both are facts about position in the file rather than about
 * the line, and a reader that got either wrong would disagree with the other pass over the same
 * bytes — which is how a filtered view comes to drop the half of a trace the unfiltered one keeps.

/**
 * Whether [row] is the tail of a message the writer had to cut in two, rather than an entry.
 *
 * Rule 2 holds only up to a point. `android.util.Log.e(tag, msg, tr)` does not hand liblog a
 * message longer than the logger's payload — `printlns` in AOSP's `Log.java` walks the string and
 * emits it as *several* entries, breaking at the last newline that fits. Each of those is a real
 * entry with its own prefix, written by its own `writev`, and logd stores them separately: a 5.7 KB
 * crash arrives as one entry ending mid-trace and another beginning `\tat …`, both stamped the same
 * millisecond. The manager's own [org.matrix.vector.manager.logE] splits the same way and for the
 * same reason, since liblog would otherwise truncate the tail.
 *
 * So this is not a guess at structure — it is the *undo* of a split the writer did not choose, and
 * it is the one place the "a prefixed line is an entry" rule is knowingly overruled. It is kept
 * narrow to earn that: same tag, same process, same thread, same level, immediately adjacent, and a
 * message that reads as a tail rather than a beginning. Four writers would have to collide inside
 * one thread, at one level, on one tag, with the second opening on whitespace, before this joined
 * two things that were never one.
 *
 * Timestamps are deliberately **not** compared. The chunks leave `printlns` microseconds apart and
 * the format keeps milliseconds, so they usually match — usually is not a rule, and a boundary that
 * happened to straddle a tick would strand exactly the long trace this exists for.
 *
 * Being wrong costs a divider between two rows that stay legible either way; nothing is discarded.
