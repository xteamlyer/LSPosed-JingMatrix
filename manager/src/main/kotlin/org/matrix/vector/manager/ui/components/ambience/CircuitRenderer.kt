/**
 * Signal traces.
 *
 * The most on-theme of the set: this app manages a framework that injects code into running
 * processes, and the header quietly draws the picture of that — faint orthogonal traces, and a
 * touch that sends a **pulse travelling down the nearest one**, lighting the trace ahead of it and
 * leaving it dark behind.
 *
 * Traces are laid out with right angles only, the way a board is routed. Diagonals would read as
 * decoration; right angles read as a circuit.
