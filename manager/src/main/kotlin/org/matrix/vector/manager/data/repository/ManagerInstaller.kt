 * Installs Vector's own manager as an ordinary app.

 * The framework does not need this — the manager runs perfectly well injected into
 * `com.android.shell`, which is the default and what most people should stay on. It is offered
 * because the parasitic arrangement costs the manager a few things a normal app has: a launcher
 * icon, a place in the app list, per-app settings, notification permission that survives a reboot.
 * Some launchers also refuse to pin the shortcut [LaunchShortcut] would otherwise create, and on
 * those this is the only way to get an icon at all.
 *
 * What it costs the other way is worth knowing and is said on the screen that offers it: installed,
 * the manager is an ordinary app with ordinary permissions, so installing a module goes through the
 * system's `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` prompt instead of happening silently under the host's
 * `INSTALL_PACKAGES`.
 *
 * The daemon already expects this: `ConfigCache` resolves `org.matrix.vector.manager`, verifies its
 * signature, and remembers its UID, so an installed manager is granted the same binder as the
 * injected one and needs no further arrangement.
